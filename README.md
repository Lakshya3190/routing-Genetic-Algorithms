# Genetic Algorithms for Multi-Agent Routing Optimization
A genetic algorithm for optimized routing of multiple agents in a simple environment. The GA optimized the physics engine of all 
agents in order to obtain the most optimized route. The rectangle represents an obstacle while the circle is the target.
